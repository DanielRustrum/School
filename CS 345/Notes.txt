Day 1 08/28
------------

-- Spectrum Of Stuff --

- Databases -> Reletional Databases
- Legacy -> concentrate on:
                files/file system
                "Islands" of Info.
                "Anomalies

- Data(base) Modeling -> Relational Model & ERM
- SQL
- Other:
    -> GUI -> Databases
    -> Security


-- Flipped Class --

- Take Notes
- Not much of a lecture
- Take an active role

- no email or bblearn, slack only and prefered
- attendence, 3 freebies otherwise its 2-3%

Day 2 08/30/18
----------------------

- Miss a class: Retain Evidence, write message to absence

- Boring Stuff:
    Data & Information:
        110110011001100 <- Raw Data, No Context
        We just have the data not the info. We have the context and metadata
        Metadata <- Data about data
        Data Dictionary <- Contains metadata

        DBMS <- Collection of software to take care of data
        OS <- ...
        Application Programs <- People, Procedures/ Processes, ...
        Advantages:
            Security
            Help with Redunecncy
            Dev Cost
            Backup and Recovery
            Data Integrety
            little data inconsistancies
        Types Of DB:    
        Types Needs a criteria, what it for how is it used, centralized decenteralized
        Not all data is viable for DB

        Importance
            Pretty much unforgivable, really hard to untangle and transfer to a solid design
        
        History: Files & File Systems
            Normalization: results in a bunch of table that are interconnected
            May be better to read but is a pain to read
            Problems:
                Data intertwined together on one table
                Adhoc quieries are a nightmare
                more programming, more selective programs
                code breaks, if there are any changes to data
                Field definitions and naming conventions
                Redundencies -> islands of info. lead us to change info in multiple places, inconsistancies, and anomolies
            Anomolies: insertion, update, deletion
                
Day 7 09/18/18
