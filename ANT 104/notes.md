## Day One
### **Introduction**
> On the Syllabus
---

## Day Two
### **Anthropology**

Study of humankind and culture
4 sub fields:
- 101: Study of the human species, Hard Science
- 102: Study of cultural variartion amoung humans and impact of global  economic and political processes 
- 103: Linguistic anthropology- study of language and how language influences social life
- 104: Archaeology- study of *human history* and *prehistory* through *material remains*

course path:<br>
Neanderthals > Denisovans/Altai > Sapiens > Human Evolution > Old World Diaspora

Need To Know:<br>
Lithics > Osteology > Geology > Flora > Fauna > Climate

what we will see:
- 10-12k years ago process of domestication
- honing in on resources<br>
leads to a sever impact on the planet by humans<br>
argubly for the worst<br>
- key survival behaviour, 4to5k years urban planning
- impresive and complex arcitecture, ect.

Anthropology is connected to our political and social worlds today

How do we get to the evidence, methods and how they change over time

Anthropology is a study of the human experiences and touches many fields

### **Groups**
Not much group work, no points accociated

## Day 3
*Due Dates are on the Grading page*

Next Thursday and Tuesday, not cancelling class<br>
Distance learning activity, take care of an online activity<br>
*Recommend in the morning*

### **Crucial Topics**
### Earliest Anatomically Modern Humans (*Homo sapiens*)
part of hominins
can trace ancestry back to 65 million years ago

hominins elapse 7 million years ago

When/Where did Homo Spaiens Evolve?
Who were homo spaiens and how did they behave?
Why did they survive? how did these different spieces interact?

Out Of Africa vs. multiregional:
- Out of africa model:
  - extreme ends of these types of hypothesis
  - East Africa
  - 1.8mya Homo erectus leaves Africa
  - According to the oof model suggests homo spaiens migrated oof in 200kya and were just better fit to survive
  - most tend to focus on paleo-enviromental conditions
  - Had to compete for resources, homo spaiens end up on top
- multiregional model:
  - Love was in the air
  - Old World
  - Interbreeding and genetic mixture continues
  - Gradual process of hybridization
  - this genetic ad mixture gets to an arbituary point that they are a new species

Old world refers to everything except the americas

What is the evidence?
4 kinds of evidence:
- site location
- skeletal morphology
- lithic technology
- DNA

Site Location:<br>
Compare the two different kinds of sites, think about three different time periods<br>
The time period 200kya is the most useful to look at when finding evidence<br>

Skeletal Morphology:<br>
Won't expect to see stark contrast according to the multiregional model<br>
We can see some clearly differences in skeletal structure<br>

Lithic Technology:<br>
There isn't much difference between species that is noticable<br>

DNA:<br>
DNA analysises almost always give info, but also gives questions<br>
The archeic DNA is gone or everyone was sharing DNA<br>
Focus on mitocondrial DNA

## Day 4
> This Thursday is the first day of the world prehistory project

### **Genetic Replacement Hypothesis**
No more archeic humans after today

think that 300 thousand years ago homosapiens originated from western africa as of a year or two

As of 300kya our skeletal system was fully developed, focus on mental growth

when writing focus on sign of intelligence and compassion

can assume that hunter/gather groups were nomadic

*Goes over satelites* üç≠

relative:
  - law of super-position
  - dendrochronolgy:
  - seriation

absoulte:
  - obsidian hydration
  - numismatics
  - index fossils
  - radiometic techniques (Radio Carbon dating)
 
radio carbon dating only works with living organism

### **Arkaiologia**

archeology comes from the greek word Arkaiologia<br>
nabonidus is credited to be the first sort of archeology<br>
Herodotus consider to be the father of history also known as the father of lies<br>
Anchient archeology all tend to use some form of the stone age, bronze age, and iron age to split up periods of time.

ole worm aka olaust wormious(1588-1655)
- lemmings
- collected rarities
- intresting person

Renaissance a period of time for imperial thinking growth.

Pompeii was covered with meter of gas and preserved the area

1730s was the start of elitist groups

## Day 5
### **Arkaiologia Cont.**

napolean sent scienctist to military expositions

1500-2000 a speculitive period <br>
1700-1800 first signs of the scientific method applied to archeology

Our intrest in the past is nothing new

different schools of thought:
- Culture History: Categorize historical populations into distinct ethic and cultural groupings according to their material culture
- Processual Archaeology: With rigorous use of the scientific method it was possible to get beyond the cataloging and timelines and learn something about how the people who used the artifacts lived
- Post-processual Archaeology: criticized previous work for overemphasizing materialist interpretations of the past and ethically and politically irresponsible... emphasizes "Agency" and the subjectivity of interpretations
- Evolutionary Archaeology: employs methods of Darwinism to classify human behavior in a system over large periods of time and diverse natural area

more schools of thought than just these 4

### **Early human technology**
Fire: not new for homo sapiens<br>
Talking: we know that neanderthal was able to speak as well and had a bone in their thought that would be essential to be able to speak<br>
Creativity: Neanderthals was expressing themselves in a creative medium<br>
Lithics: Modern humans can't talk credit for creating tools<br>
Homospaiens developed the first projectile weapons<br>
Architecture: Don't get credit for architecture? under question<br>
Clothing: Neaderthal were thought of wearing pelts, clothing lice, accessories would have been attributed to modern human.
